which optimal free plugins and chain order to get the exact [title] song by [artist] [instrument] tone using a real plugged in [instrument] to [DAW] (Reaper VST plugins available for any DAW), and which pickup selection/volume & how much of the tone knob on the real [instrument] that's plugged in?

which optimal free plugins and chain order to get the exact [title] song by [artist] [section] [instrument] part [layer] labelled [effect] tone using a real plugged in [instrument] to [DAW], and which pickup selection/volume & how much of the tone knob on the real [instrument] that's plugged in?

Get Optimal Plugin:

which free [type of] Plugin including any free [ex. pedal, amp sim] vst's online would be the most accurate for this chain to get closest to the song's guitar [type ex. lead, rhythm, sample] tone

Multiple Optimal Plugins (Example):

which free eq, compressor, and "Ambience/Space (Reverb/Delay)" plugins including any vst's online would be the most accurate for those parts of this chain to get closest to the song's guitar lead tone?

Confirm Optimal Plugins:

which free plugins for that chain would be most accurate to the exact guitar tone in that song?

Review Chain Order:

so considering everything what would the final plugin chain order be for most accurate to that song's [instrument] [layer] tone for the [section] part?

Example - the chain from all your suggestions includes tse 808, emissary amp sim, lecab ir's 6 layer loader, reaverb with small live room ir, tdr nova eq, reacomp, oldskoolverb, then readelay. Should the order of those be changed at all for getting most accurate to the song's exact guitar tone?   

Confirm Plugin:

to be closest to the exact song tone for this chain would [plugin name] be the most accurate free plugin or a different one?

in the chain would [plugin] be the best free plugin or is there a more accurate one for this song's tone?
